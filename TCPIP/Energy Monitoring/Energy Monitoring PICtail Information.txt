Google, Inc. has deprecated Google PowerMeter and expressed its intent to remove access to it on 
September 16, 2011.  

Because of this development, Microchip Technology has removed the Google PowerMeter demo projects
from the Microchip Application Libraries distribution.  To obtain Microchip's Google PowerMeter
reference implementation, please download the archived Microchip Application Libraries installation
from June, 2011 from www.microchip.com/mal.

This Energy Monitoring demo has been modified to remove its Google PowerMeter upload features.
However, the energy measurements made by the PICtail can still be viewed on the demo board-hosted
web page.

The PC GUI for the Energy Monitoring PICtail can be obtained from:
