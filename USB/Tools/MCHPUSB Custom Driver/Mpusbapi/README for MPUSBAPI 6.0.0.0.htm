<h2>What is MPUSBAPI.DLL?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>MPUSBAPI is a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) useful when writing
PC application software that needs to communicate with custom/vendor class USB
devices.  The MPUSBAPI.DLL exposes a variety of high level Application
Programming Interface (API) functions that the PC application software
developer can call, in order to perform basic tasks, such as reading and
writing data with the target USB device.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order for a PC application to communicate with a USB
device, the PC application software must first “find and connect” to the USB
device.  USB is a plug and play serial communication bus technology, and there
can be many USB devices simultaneously attached to a host PC.  Before the PC application
can begin communicating with a specific USB device of interest, the PC
application software must first search the machine to find  a matching USB
device with the proper identifiers (such as the USB Vendor ID (VID) and Product
ID (PID) numbers, which are intended to be unique for all different USB device
product lines).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The process of searching the machine and finding a specific
USB device (with matching VID/PID) can be somewhat complicated.  On a Microsoft
Windows based PC, it is possible to find specific USB devices using operating
system provided Win32 API function calls.  However, doing so requires many
function calls, a moderate amount of programming expertise, and a moderate
amount of human time investment learning the process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately, the process can be simplified by using a
dynamic link library, such as MPUSBAPI.DLL.  The MPUSBAPI.DLL contains all of
the code needed to call the Win32 API function calls needed to find and connect
to a USB device.  The complexity of finding the USB device can be hidden behind
a high level API function.  Therefore, the PC application developer can simply
call one function (ex: MPUSBOpen(), provided by MPUSBAPI.DLL) to find and
connect to his/her USB device, without needing to learn and repeatedly call several
Win32 API functions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The MPUSBAPI.DLL also provides other high level API
functions which make other interfacing tasks (such as reading/writing USB
packets to an endpoint on the device) easy.   All versions of MPUSBAPI.DLL
provide the following API functions.  Some versions also support some
additional API functions as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>MPUSBGetDeviceCount()   //Returns
     the number of matching USB devices connected to the machine</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>MPUSBOpen()             //Used
     to find and connect to a USB device</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>MPUSBClose()            //Used
     to “disconnect” from a USB device</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>MPUSBRead()             //Used
     for reading IN data packets from a “bulk” endpoint on the USB device</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>MPUSBReadInt()          //Used
     for reading IN data packets from an “interrupt” endpoint on the USB device</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>MPUSBWrite()            //Used
     for sending OUT data packets to an endpoint on the USB device</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>MPUSBGetDLLVersion()    //Returns
     the MPUSBAPI.DLL version number</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a full list of supported API functions, please see the
mpusbapi header file and MPUSBAPI.DLL source code comments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the MPUSBAPI.DLL was written in Borland C++ Builder
6.0, it is possible to use the MPUSBAPI.DLL in many other programming
languages/development environments, either directly or by creating simple
wrapper classes.  Some example PC application projects and source code using the
MPUSBAPI.DLL are provided in the MCHPFSUSB Framework.  The source code for the
MPUSBAPI.DLL file is also provided in the MCHPFSUSB Framework.</p>

<h2>What is MPUSBAPI.DLL v6.0.0.0, and how does it differ from MPUSBAPI.DLL
v1.x.x.x?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The original MPUSBAPI.DLL file version 1.0.0.0 was created
by Microchip, and was released as part of the MCHFPSUSB Framework v1.0 in
November of 2004.  The original MPUSBAPI.DLL version 1.x.x.x files are intended
to be used in conjunction with the Microchip general purpose, custom/vendor
class driver (mchpusb.sys or mchpusb64.sys for 64-bit OSes).  The MPUSBAPI.DLL
cannot be used to interface with other USB devices of other USB device classes,
such as HID, MSD, CDC, etc.  In order to use the API functions provided by
MPUSBAPI.DLL, the USB device firmware must be designed for the custom/vendor
class (which is potentially the simplest of all USB classes).  Upon plugging in
the USB device with the custom/vendor class firmware, the driver package that
must be installed for the device must be the Microchip custom class driver
(mchpusb.sys or mchpusb64.sys for 64-bit OSes), in order to use the
MPUSBAPI.DLL v1.x.x.x.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Operating system vendors, such as Microsoft, typically
provide several built in USB drivers that get distributed with their operating
systems.  These drivers are useful for common types of USB devices, such as HID
class keyboards and mice, MSD class USB memory drives, etc.  Back in November
of 2004, Windows based operating systems did not provide any drivers suitable
for general purpose read/write interfacing with a vendor/custom class USB
device.  Therefore, Microchip developed and released the mchpusb.sys custom USB
driver to help satisfy this industry need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since then, Microsoft has also recognized the usefulness of
a general purpose USB device driver, necessary for supporting custom/vendor
class USB devices.  Therefore, Microsoft has created and released the “WinUSB”
device driver (winusb.sys) along with a DLL file (winusb.dll) for providing
high level API access to the USB device.  The WinUSB driver and API were
originally released in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) version 6001, approximately
coinciding with the release of Windows Vista operating system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The WinUSB driver (winusb.sys) and API DLL (winusb.dll) may
be used on Windows XP SP2 and later operating systems, and are very similar in
functionality and purpose as the Microchip general purpose USB driver
(mchpusb.sys/mchpusb64.sys) and API DLL (MPUSBAPI.DLL).  However, the WinUSB
driver and API is newer and support more advanced functionality than the Microchip
general purpose driver and API.  The API functions available when using WinUSB
are powerful, and come with complete documentation.  If developing a new USB
application, which will be based on the custom/vendor device class, it is
suggested by the present author to consider using the WinUSB driver and API. 
Example firmware and PC application software projects showing how to implement
a complete USB device based on the WinUSB driver and API are provided in the
MCHPFSUSB Framework.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due to the similarities in the functionality and purpose of
WinUSB (compared to the Microchip custom driver and API), it is relatively easy
to migrate existing USB designs based on the Microchip custom driver and
MPUSBAPI.DLL, to use the WinUSB driver and API (winusb.dll) instead.  In
practice, it is normally not required to make any changes to the USB
microcontroller firmware to migrate a design, between these drivers/APIs.  In
most cases, only the PC application and the driver package distributed to the
end consumer have to be modified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The winusb.dll API functions are very similar to those
provided by MPUSBAPI.DLL, but the functions are not identical in name and in
input/output parameters.  It is possible however, to create a “wrapper” DLL,
which exposes identical API function names and parameters as the MPUSBAPI.DLL
(v1.x.x.x), but internally converts the requests into WinUSB requests.  It is
therefore possible to make a newer mpusbapi.dll, which incorporates both the
code needed to interface with the mchpusb driver, or the WinUSB driver (through
the use of “wrapper” functions that call winusb.dll API functions).  The
MPUSBAPI.DLL, file version 6.0.0.0 implements this capability.  During
application runtime, the DLL determines which driver package is installed for
the USB device (either mchpusb or WinUSB), and calls the appropriate lower
level functions to interface with the device, while still maintaining almost
identical top level API functionality and support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By using the MPUSBAPI.DLL v6.0.0.0, it is possible in most
cases to seamlessly migrate between using the Microchip custom driver, and
WinUSB, usually with no modifications whatsoever to either the PC application
software, or the microcontroller firmware.  Most applications can be migrated
from [mchpusb+mpusbapi.dll (based on mchpusb)] to [WinUSB+mpusbapi.dll (based on
WinUSB)] with the following steps:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Delete all old copies of mpusbapi.dll (v1.x.x.x) from the
     target PC.&nbsp; Most likely, these instances will be located in the same
     directory as the [application name].exe program that uses the mpusbapi.dll
     file. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Copy the new mpusbapi.dll file (v6.0.0.0) to where the old
     mpusbapi.dll file used to reside (most likely the same directory as the executable
     that uses the DLL).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Completely uninstall and remove all traces of the old
     mchpusb.sys based driver package.&nbsp; See the “[MCHPFSUSB Framework
     Install Location]\USB Tools\Super Device Manager\Readme Driver
     Removal.doc” for instructions on how to do this.  Failure to completely
     remove the old driver package may result in the operating system automatically
     re-installing the same (old driver package) upon re-attaching the
     hardware.  Cached driver package copies may still exist on the system, and
     if Windows finds more than one driver that appears to be compatible with
     the device (correct VID/PID match between microcontroller firmware and
     .inf file), then it will use a “ranking” method to determine which driver
     to actually install.  </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Modify a pre-existing WinUSB based driver package (such as
     “[MCHPFSUSB Framework Install Location]\USB Device - WinUSB - High
     Bandwidth Demo\Driver and INF\MCHPWinUSBDevice_v2.inf”) to include the
     proper VID/PID combinations intended to be supported. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Plug in the hardware and install the WinUSB driver package
     for the hardware using the above modified .inf file (in step 3). </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Verify that the WinUSB driver was correctly installed for
     the device.  Check the “Driver Details…” menu in the device manager
     properties page for the USB device.  WinUSB.sys should be listed, if the
     correct driver is associated with the device.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Run the [application name].exe and thoroughly verify that
     all of the USB functionality still works normally. </li>
</ol>
