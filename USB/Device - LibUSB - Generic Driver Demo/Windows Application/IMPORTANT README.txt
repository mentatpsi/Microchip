The SimpleLibusbDemo.exe program was written in Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition.

Therefore, in order to use this program, you will need to have the .NET framework version 3.5
or later installed on your computer.  If you do not have the .NET framework 3.5 installed, a 
non-descript error message will occur when trying to launch the executable, and the program 
will not open.  You may also need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributeable Package.

You may already have the .NET framework installed on your PC, especially if you have already installed
other applications which were built with one of the Visual Studio 2008 .NET languages.  If you do not
yet have it, the .NET framework can be freely downloaded from Microsoft's website.  

The .NET 3.5 redistributables is currently (10 July 2009) available at:

In order to build the PC application source code, you will need to install:

Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition 
(other editions or later versions are believed to work however, this is not tested, and once the project is converted 
over to a newer version or more advanced version, the project will probably not be openable in 2008 Express Edition anymore). 


The tool is currently distributed by Microsoft free of charge.  Currently (22 Jan 2009), it 
can be downloaded from:
