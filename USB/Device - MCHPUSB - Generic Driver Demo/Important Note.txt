The Generic Driver Demo firmware relies the the custom (vendor) class 
Microchip USB driver: mchpusb.sys (or mchpusb64.sys on 64 bit platforms).

After programming a device with the generic driver demo firmware, the Found 
New Hardware Wizard should appear.  When the wizard appears, point it to the
driver which is located in the following directory:

<install directory>\USB Tools\MCHPUSB Custom Driver\MCHPUSB Driver\Release
