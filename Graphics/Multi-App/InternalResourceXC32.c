 * Copyright (C) 1999 Arphic Technology Co., Ltd. 
 * 11Fl. No.168, Yung Chi Rd., Taipei, 110 Taiwan 
 * All rights reserved except as specified below. 
 *  
 * Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
 * license document, but changing it is forbidden. 
 *  
 * Preamble 
 *  
 *    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom 
 * to share and change it. By contrast, the ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE 
 * specifically permits and encourages you to use this software, provided 
 * that you give the recipients all the rights that we gave you and make 
 * sure they can get the modifications of this software. 
 *  
 * Legal Terms 
 *  
 * 0. Definitions: 
 *    Throughout this License, "Font" means the TrueType fonts "AR PL 
 * Mingti2L Big5", "AR PL KaitiM Big5" (BIG-5 character set) and "AR PL 
 * SungtiL GB", "AR PL KaitiM GB" (GB character set) which are originally 
 * distributed by Arphic, and the derivatives of those fonts created 
 * through any modification including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, 
 * converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting some 
 * characters in/from glyph table. 
 *  
 *    "PL" means "Public License". 
 *  
 *    "Copyright Holder" means whoever is named in the copyright or 
 * copyrights for the Font. 
 *  
 *    "You" means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or 
 * modifying the Font. 
 *  
 *    "Freely Available" means that you have the freedom to copy or modify 
 * the Font as well as redistribute copies of the Font under the same 
 * conditions you received, not price. If you wish, you can charge for this 
 * service. 
 *  
 * 1. Copying & Distribution 
 *    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in any 
 * medium, without restriction, provided that you retain this license file 
 * (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered in all copies. 
 *  
 * 2. Modification 
 *    You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way, including 
 * modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font 
 * name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from glyph table, and copy 
 * and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, 
 * provided that the following conditions are met: 
 *  
 *    a) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating 
 * how and when you changed that file. 
 *  
 *    b) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to 
 * all third parties under the terms of this License, such as by offering 
 * access to copy the modifications from a designated place, or 
 * distributing the modifications on a medium customarily used for software 
 * interchange. 
 *  
 *    c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when 
 * run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in 
 * the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
 * appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or 
 * else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may 
 * redistribute the Font under these conditions, and telling the user how 
 * to view a copy of this License. 
 *  
 *    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
 * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Font, and 
 * can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
 * themselves, then this License and its terms, do not apply to those 
 * sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore, mere 
 * aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the Font on a 
 * volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work 
 * under the scope of this License. 
 *  
 * 3. Condition Subsequent 
 *    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font except 
 * as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
 * modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will automatically 
 * retroactively void your rights under this License. However, parties who 
 * have received copies or rights from you under this License will keep 
 * their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 *  
 * 4. Acceptance 
 *    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
 * signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify, 
 * sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions are prohibited by law 
 * if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by copying, modifying, 
 * sublicensing or distributing the Font, you indicate your acceptance of 
 * this License and all its terms and conditions. 
 *  
 * 5. Automatic Receipt 
 *    Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically 
 * receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or 
 * modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. You may not 
 * impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
 * rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
 * by third parties to this License. 
 *  
 * 6. Contradiction 
 *    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute 
 * so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
 * any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
 * distribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent license would not 
 * permit royalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those who receive 
 * copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could 
 * satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
 * distribution of the Font. 
 *  
 *    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
 * any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
 * apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
 * circumstances. 
 *  
 * 7. NO WARRANTY 
 *    BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
 * THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES 
 * PROVIDE THE FONT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
 * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
 * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT 
 * PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR 
 * OR CORRECTION. 
 *  
 * 8. DAMAGES WAIVER 
 *    UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO 
 * EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY 
 * OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY 
 * DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY 
 * DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT (INCLUDING 
 * BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF 
 * USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR 
 * OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 * All rights reserved except as specified below. 
 *  
 * Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
 * license document, but changing it is forbidden. 
 *  
 * Preamble 
 *  
 *    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom 
 * to share and change it. By contrast, the ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE 
 * specifically permits and encourages you to use this software, provided 
 * that you give the recipients all the rights that we gave you and make 
 * sure they can get the modifications of this software. 
 *  
 * Legal Terms 
 *  
 * 0. Definitions: 
 *    Throughout this License, "Font" means the TrueType fonts "AR PL 
 * Mingti2L Big5", "AR PL KaitiM Big5" (BIG-5 character set) and "AR PL 
 * SungtiL GB", "AR PL KaitiM GB" (GB character set) which are originally 
 * distributed by Arphic, and the derivatives of those fonts created 
 * through any modification including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, 
 * converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting some 
 * characters in/from glyph table. 
 *  
 *    "PL" means "Public License". 
 *  
 *    "Copyright Holder" means whoever is named in the copyright or 
 * copyrights for the Font. 
 *  
 *    "You" means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or 
 * modifying the Font. 
 *  
 *    "Freely Available" means that you have the freedom to copy or modify 
 * the Font as well as redistribute copies of the Font under the same 
 * conditions you received, not price. If you wish, you can charge for this 
 * service. 
 *  
 * 1. Copying & Distribution 
 *    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in any 
 * medium, without restriction, provided that you retain this license file 
 * (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered in all copies. 
 *  
 * 2. Modification 
 *    You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way, including 
 * modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font 
 * name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from glyph table, and copy 
 * and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, 
 * provided that the following conditions are met: 
 *  
 *    a) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating 
 * how and when you changed that file. 
 *  
 *    b) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to 
 * all third parties under the terms of this License, such as by offering 
 * access to copy the modifications from a designated place, or 
 * distributing the modifications on a medium customarily used for software 
 * interchange. 
 *  
 *    c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when 
 * run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in 
 * the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
 * appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or 
 * else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may 
 * redistribute the Font under these conditions, and telling the user how 
 * to view a copy of this License. 
 *  
 *    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
 * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Font, and 
 * can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
 * themselves, then this License and its terms, do not apply to those 
 * sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore, mere 
 * aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the Font on a 
 * volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work 
 * under the scope of this License. 
 *  
 * 3. Condition Subsequent 
 *    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font except 
 * as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
 * modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will automatically 
 * retroactively void your rights under this License. However, parties who 
 * have received copies or rights from you under this License will keep 
 * their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 *  
 * 4. Acceptance 
 *    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
 * signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify, 
 * sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions are prohibited by law 
 * if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by copying, modifying, 
 * sublicensing or distributing the Font, you indicate your acceptance of 
 * this License and all its terms and conditions. 
 *  
 * 5. Automatic Receipt 
 *    Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically 
 * receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or 
 * modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. You may not 
 * impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
 * rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance 
 * by third parties to this License. 
 *  
 * 6. Contradiction 
 *    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute 
 * so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
 * any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
 * distribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent license would not 
 * permit royalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those who receive 
 * copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could 
 * satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
 * distribution of the Font. 
 *  
 *    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
 * any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
 * apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
 * circumstances. 
 *  
 * 7. NO WARRANTY 
 *    BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
 * THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES 
 * PROVIDE THE FONT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
 * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
 * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT 
 * PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR 
 * OR CORRECTION. 
 *  
 * 8. DAMAGES WAIVER 
 *    UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO 
 * EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY 
 * OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY 
 * DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY 
 * DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT (INCLUDING 
 * BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF 
 * USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR 
 * OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 * 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
 * 		       Version 2, June 1991 
 *  
 * Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
 * 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA 
 * Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 * of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 *  
 * 			    Preamble 
 *  
 * The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
 * freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public 
 * License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
 * software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This 
 * General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
 * Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to 
 * using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by 
 * the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to 
 * your programs, too. 
 *  
 * When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not 
 * price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
 * have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
 * this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it 
 * if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it 
 * in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 
 *  
 * To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
 * anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
 * These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
 * distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 *  
 * For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
 * gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
 * you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
 * source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
 * rights. 
 *  
 * We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
 * (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
 * distribute and/or modify the software. 
 *  
 * Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
 * that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
 * software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
 * want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
 * that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
 * authors' reputations. 
 *  
 * Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
 * patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
 * program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
 * program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
 * patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 *  
 * The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
 * modification follow. 
 *  
 * 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
 *    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 *  
 * 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
 * a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
 * under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, 
 * refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" 
 * means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
 * that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
 * either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
 * language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
 * the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 *  
 * Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
 * covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
 * running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
 * is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
 * Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
 * Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 *  
 * 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
 * source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
 * conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
 * copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
 * notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
 * and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
 * along with the Program. 
 *  
 * You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
 * you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 *  
 * 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
 * of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
 * distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
 * above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
 *  
 *     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
 *     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 *  
 *     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
 *     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
 *     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
 *     parties under the terms of this License. 
 *  
 *     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
 *     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
 *     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
 *     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
 *     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
 *     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
 *     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
 *     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
 *     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
 *     the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
 *  
 * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
 * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
 * and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
 * themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
 * sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
 * distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
 * on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
 * this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
 * entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 *  
 * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
 * your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
 * exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
 * collective works based on the Program. 
 *  
 * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
 * with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
 * a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
 * the scope of this License. 
 *  
 * 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
 * under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
 * Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 *  
 *     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
 *     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
 *     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 *  
 *     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
 *     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
 *     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
 *     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
 *     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
 *     customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 *  
 *     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
 *     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
 *     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
 *     received the program in object code or executable form with such 
 *     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 *  
 * The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
 * making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
 * code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
 * associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
 * control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
 * special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
 * anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
 * form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
 * operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
 * itself accompanies the executable. 
 *  
 * If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
 * access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
 * access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
 * distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
 * compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
 *  
 * 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
 * except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
 * otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
 * void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
 * However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
 * this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
 * parties remain in full compliance. 
 *  
 * 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
 * signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
 * distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
 * prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
 * modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
 * Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
 * all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
 * the Program or works based on it. 
 *  
 * 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
 * Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
 * original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
 * these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
 * restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
 * You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
 * this License. 
 *  
 * 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
 * distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
 * License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
 * may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
 * license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
 * all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
 * the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
 * refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 *  
 * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
 * any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
 * apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
 * circumstances. 
 *  
 * It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
 * patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
 * such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
 * integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
 * implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
 * generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
 * through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
 * system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
 * to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
 * impose that choice. 
 *  
 * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
 * be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
 *  
 * 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
 * certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
 * original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
 * may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
 * those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
 * countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
 * the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 *  
 * 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
 * of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
 * be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
 * address new problems or concerns. 
 *  
 * Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
 * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
 * later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
 * either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
 * Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
 * this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
 * Foundation. 
 *  
 * 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
 * programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
 * to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
 * Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
 * make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
 * of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
 * of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 *  
 * 			    NO WARRANTY 
 *  
 * 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
 * FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
 * PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
 * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
 * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
 * PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
 * REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 *  
 * 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
 * WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
 * REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
 * INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
 * OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
 * TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
 * YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
 * PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
 * POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 *  
 * 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 *  
 * 	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 *  
 *   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
 * possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
 * free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 *  
 *   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
 * to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
 * convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
 * the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 *  
 *     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
 *     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> 
 *  
 *     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
 *     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
 *     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
 *     (at your option) any later version. 
 *  
 *     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
 *     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
 *     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
 *     GNU General Public License for more details. 
 *  
 *     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
 *     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
 *     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301 
 *  USA 
 *  
 *  
 * Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 *  
 * If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
 * when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 *  
 *     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author 
 *     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
 *     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
 *     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. 
 *  
 * The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
 * parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
 * be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
 * mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 *  
 * You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
 * school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
 * necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 *  
 *   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
 *   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. 
 *  
 *   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 
 *   Ty Coon, President of Vice 
 *  
 * This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
 * proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
 * consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
 * library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General 
 * Public License instead of this License.

 * When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

 *  
 * To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
 * anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
 * These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
 * distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
 *  
 * For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether 
 * gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that 
 * you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
 * source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
 * rights. 
 *  
 * We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
 * (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
 * distribute and/or modify the software. 
 *  
 * Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
 * that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
 * software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
 * want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
 * that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
 * authors' reputations. 
 *  
 * Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
 * patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free 
 * program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the 
 * program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any 
 * patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
 *  
 * The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
 * modification follow. 
 *  
 * 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
 *    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 *  
 * 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains 
 * a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
 * under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, 
 * refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" 
 * means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: 
 * that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, 
 * either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another 
 * language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in 
 * the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 *  
 * Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
 * covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
 * running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program 
 * is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
 * Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
 * Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 
 *  
 * 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's 
 * source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
 * conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
 * copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
 * notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
 * and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
 * along with the Program. 
 *  
 * You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
 * you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
 *  
 * 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion 
 * of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
 * distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
 * above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 
 *  
 *     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
 *     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
 *  
 *     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
 *     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
 *     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
 *     parties under the terms of this License. 
 *  
 *     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively 
 *     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such 
 *     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an 
 *     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
 *     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide 
 *     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under 
 *     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this 
 *     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but 
 *     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on 
 *     the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
 *  
 * These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If 
 * identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
 * and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
 * themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
 * sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you 
 * distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 
 * on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
 * this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
 * entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
 *  
 * Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
 * your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
 * exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
 * collective works based on the Program. 
 *  
 * In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
 * with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of 
 * a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 
 * the scope of this License. 
 *  
 * 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
 * under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
 * Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
 *  
 *     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
 *     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
 *     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 *  
 *     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
 *     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your 
 *     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete 
 *     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
 *     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
 *     customarily used for software interchange; or, 
 *  
 *     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer 
 *     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is 
 *     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you 
 *     received the program in object code or executable form with such 
 *     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
 *  
 * The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
 * making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source 
 * code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
 * associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
 * control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a 
 * special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
 * anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
 * form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
 * operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
 * itself accompanies the executable. 
 *  
 * If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
 * access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
 * access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
 * distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
 * compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
 *  
 * 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
 * except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt 
 * otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
 * void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
 * However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
 * this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such 
 * parties remain in full compliance. 
 *  
 * 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
 * signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
 * distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are 
 * prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
 * modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
 * Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
 * all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
 * the Program or works based on it. 
 *  
 * 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
 * Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
 * original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
 * these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
 * restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
 * You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to 
 * this License. 
 *  
 * 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
 * infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
 * conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
 * otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
 * excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot 
 * distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
 * License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
 * may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
 * license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by 
 * all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
 * the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
 * refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. 
 *  
 * If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
 * any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
 * apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
 * circumstances. 
 *  
 * It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
 * patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
 * such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
 * integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
 * implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
 * generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
 * through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
 * system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
 * to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
 * impose that choice. 
 *  
 * This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
 * be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
 *  
 * 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
 * certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
 * original copyright holder who places the Program under this License 
 * may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
 * those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 
 * countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates 
 * the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 
 *  
 * 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
 * of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will 
 * be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
 * address new problems or concerns. 
 *  
 * Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program 
 * specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
 * later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions 
 * either of that version or of any later version published by the Free 
 * Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of 
 * this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
 * Foundation. 
 *  
 * 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
 * programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author 
 * to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
 * Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes 
 * make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals 
 * of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
 * of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. 
 *  
 * 			    NO WARRANTY 
 *  
 * 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
 * FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN 
 * OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
 * PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED 
 * OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS 
 * TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE 
 * PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
 * REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 *  
 * 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
 * WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
 * REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
 * INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
 * OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
 * TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY 
 * YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
 * PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
 * POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
 *  
 * 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 *  
 * 	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs 
 *  
 *   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
 * possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
 * free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. 
 *  
 *   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest 
 * to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 
 * convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least 
 * the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 
 *  
 *     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
 *     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> 
 *  
 *     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify 
 *     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by 
 *     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or 
 *     (at your option) any later version. 
 *  
 *     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
 *     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
 *     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the 
 *     GNU General Public License for more details. 
 *  
 *     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License 
 *     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software 
 *     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301 
 *  USA 
 *  
 *  
 * Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 
 *  
 * If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
 * when it starts in an interactive mode: 
 *  
 *     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author 
 *     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
 *     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it 
 *     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. 
 *  
 * The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate 
 * parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may 
 * be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be 
 * mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. 
 *  
 * You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
 * school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if 
 * necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names: 
 *  
 *   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
 *   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. 
 *  
 *   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989 
 *   Ty Coon, President of Vice 
 *  
 * This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
 * proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may 
 * consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the 
 * library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General 
 * Public License instead of this License.
